Description:
    This program makes use of friend functions and classes to showcase the 
    value of their applications.

Note:
    In object calc we declared class calc_test as a friend so that calc_test 
    will have access to necessary functions and variables in calc. calc_test is 
    on object tests the implementation of calc class

    the assert() functions will check the statement in the braces. If the expression
    evaluates to true, then the program will continue running. 
    If false, the program will terminate.

    we also implemented function overloading by having a function to use integers
    and a function to use doubles.

    debugging the program shows us that the destructor is called at the end of the
    program or whenever the object goes out of scope.

    Order of Construction and Destruction:
        ct: constructed
        calc_test: constructed
        ctest: constructed

        ctest: desctructed
        calc_test: desctructed
        ct: desctructed
