Description:
    This program demonstrates the use of namespaces. namespaces are a collection
    of classes, functions, and variables, and group code that is
    functionally related. We have created 2 namespaces, IntCalc and DoubleCalc.

Note:

    In the namespaces, In the program we have four instances of result.
    We can differentiate it using the scope resolution operator.

    The keyword extern tells the compiler that a variable is declared in another
    source module (outside of the current scope).
    
    If the global variables are not externed in the .h file, the linker will
    complain of multiple definitions.
    If the global variables are not defined in the .cpp file, the compiler will
    complain about undefined references

    You can change the value of global variables using the scope resolution
    operator (::)
    example:
    you can change the global variable result int main() by using
        ::result = 200;
    you can change the result variable in the IntCalc namespace by using
        IntCalc::result = 200;
    you can change the result variable in the DoubleCalc namespace by using
        DoubleCalc::result = 200;
