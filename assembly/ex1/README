Description:
This program is used as an example to generate assembly code.
The command to generate assembly code from the command line is:
    g++ -S main.cpp
    outputs file to main.s, which contains the assembly instructions

Note:
    The print() function is overloaded, so there are 2 instances of
    the function in assembly.

    Notice the names of the print() function are mangled, but main
    us not.
    printi = takes an integer parameter
    printc = takes a characte paramter

    The global variables are declared in the global section of assembly

    We have defined a function sleep() which takes a default value of 5.
    We found one instance of the function in the assembly code.
    sleep() is called twice in main, as sleep(1) and sleep(). In assembly, we 
    see that there is a call to sleep where a value of one is pushed and a call
    where a value of 5 is pushed.
